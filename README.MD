# Vocabulary Trainer
The vocabulary trainer is a small application that supports Korean language learning.
It takes selected Korean web article URLs as an input, extracts key vocabulary from those articles, and then displays flash cards for learning that vocabulary.

The goal is to better understand the Korean article afterwards.


## Getting Started
To run the application locally, clone the repo, and then run:  
`python manage.py runserver`

## Prerequisites
See requirements.txt
