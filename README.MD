# Vocabulary Trainer
The vocabulary trainer is a small application that supports Korean language learning.
A user can enter either a Korean web article URL (via the `URL INPUT` tab), or some Korean text (via the `TEXT INPUT` tab).
The application then extracts key vocabulary from the input text, and displays flash cards for learning that vocabulary.

The goal is to better understand the Korean article afterwards.

## Getting Started
To run the application locally, clone the repo, and then run:  
`python manage.py runserver`


## Prerequisites
See requirements.txt

## Notes
The app uses the googletrans python module for looking up term translations.  
There is still work to be done in terms of source term preprocessing, contextualizing translations etc.
