<h1>Vocabulary Trainer</h1>
<p>The vocabulary trainer is a small application that supports Korean language learning.
    A user can enter either a Korean web article URL (via the `URL INPUT` tab), or some Korean text (via the `TEXT INPUT` tab).
    The application then extracts key vocabulary from the input text, and displays flash cards for learning that vocabulary.</p>
<p>The goal is to better understand the Korean article afterwards.</p>
